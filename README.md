# inspirational-quote

First complete project on using Fetch API onClick events to generate new quotes.  
Project was completed in Dec. 2020 and was given an administrational update in Feb. 2021

*No new updates of this project are expected as I would like this project to be a reference on my progress throughout time.*

You can look at a live demo of the project [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/koukoumpitsa/inspirational-quote)

**Learning Objectives:**
- Combine Fetch API within components and adding onClick event handler.
- Deeper understaning on json files - what they send and how do we use the data we receive
- How to properly use the useStates generated from Fetch in components.

**Things learnt or to be improved:**
- Fetch API should most definetly be in a seperate file as the App.js is becoming very cluttered  
- Need to figured out how to use APIs with authkeys 
- Container.js needs to become more dry -create more child components  
- Responsiveness of app is lacking 
- Use Styled Components in the future as right now the styles.css is too long and unreadable
